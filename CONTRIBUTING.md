# Contributing to LaunchDarkly JavaScript Test Helpers

## Submitting bug reports and feature requests

The LaunchDarkly SDK team monitors the [issue tracker](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-test-helpers/issues) in the SDK repository for bug reports and feature requests. Note that this is meant to remain a lightweight library, so major feature additions are unlikely unless the LaunchDarkly SDK projects have new testing needs.

## Submitting pull requests

We encourage pull requests and other contributions from the community. Before submitting pull requests, ensure that all temporary or unintended code is removed. Don't worry about adding reviewers to the pull request; the LaunchDarkly team will add themselves.
