## [1.2.0] - 2020-04-23
### Added:
- Methods in `TestHttpServer` for creating simple proxy servers.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-12-03
### Added:
- `TestHttpServers`, containing the same static factory methods that are in `TestHttpServer`. This is a workaround for a transpiler problem that can prevent imports from working correctly for classes that have a constructor as well as static methods.

Initial release.
